:exclamation: This is a fork of [DatoCMS's gatsby portfolio sample](https://github.com/datocms/gatsby-portfolio) :exclamation: 

There are tons of site builders around and why they're so effective (especially for people not versed in dev work) is because they offer a Content Management System (CMS) that makes it easy for users to update site data.

This project is a static site built with Gatsby, and uses DatoCMS to store all the content + deploy the site. There were tons of templates online but I found that they had *too much information* and were too cluttered when all I needed was a simple promo page. 

It's similar to what **Carousell** does, but this is a site only for one merchant :P

Kept it for a bit, but this is no longer used. Feel free to refer to it for anything~
- [gatsby-source-datocms](https://github.com/datocms/gatsby-source-datocms) to integrate the website with DatoCMS.
